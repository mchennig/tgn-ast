This repository contains the implementation of the TGN-AST hybrid model for the predictive process monitoring of remaining times, next activities and next timestamps as described in our paper "Leveraging Temporal Graphs for Enhancing Transformer-based Predictive Process Monitoring". Additionally, all preprocessing and evaluation steps as well as benchmark model developments are included.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
   Predictive process monitoring (PPM) utilizes event logs to forecast process outcomes and behaviors. While existing approaches effectively model simple control-flow patterns, they often overlook organizational and resource information embedded in the event log. Therefore, we develop TGN-AST, a novel hybrid model that leverages this context information to improve predictions, using a design science approach. TGN-AST combines the benefits of temporal graph neural networks and transformer-based sequence modeling to predict processes with resource and organization structures. It extracts organizational relations from event logs as continuous-time dynamic graphs, learns temporal node embeddings that capture the evolution of relationships, and incorporates these in a multi-task transformer model. The evaluation of TGN-AST across multiple real-world IT Service Management event logs reveals statistically significant and incremental performance improvements, particularly in next activity predictions. The findings highlight that integrating a temporal graph network with a transformer enhances predictive performance, bridging the gap between sequential and graph-based process analysis. Furthermore, our research provides empirical evidence underscoring the utility of temporal context modeling in improving the accuracy of predictions.

## Overview

TGN-AST is a novel hybrid approach that combines Temporal Graph Networks (TGN) with Attribute Selection Transformers (AST) to enhance the performance of predictive process monitoring tasks. Our model captures both the temporal graph structure of business processes and the sequential patterns in process execution data.
